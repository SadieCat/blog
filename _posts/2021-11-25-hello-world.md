I've finally gone and done it.

I've been promising people I would set up a blog soon so that I can write long-form notes on various things for a while but I've been put off by how tracker-laden commercial blogging platforms are and how maintenance-heavy the open source alternatives are. I'm still not satisfied but I at least don't completely hate Jekyll with this theme so it'll do for now. 

Keep watching this space.
